  Zookeeper k8s sidecar charm
summary: |
  This Juju charm deploys Apache ZooKeeper on top of Kubernetes. It is
  implemented using the Charmed Operator Framework, designed to deploy a
  standard OCI (e.g. Docker) ZooKeeper image alongside a sidecar container
  containing the Juju operator logic.
  .
  Apache ZooKeeper is a service for storing the configuration (key-value store)
  of a distributed system and helping with synchronization between components of
  that system.
